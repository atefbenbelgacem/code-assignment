# Code Assignment

The tasks include topics that are important to us. Even if you only have answers to part of the exercises, it's already a starting point!

## Tasks

Your take-home assignment consists of 3 different tasks that can be found in the `tasks` folder. In each subfolder, you'll find the `index.ts` file with code and `INDEX.md` with questions and instructions on what needs to be done. The tasks can be done in any order you want, they are not dependent on each other.

## Constraints

- This assignment has been designed to be solved between 45 minutes to 1h30.
- Your answers need to be in the dedicated `INDEX.md` file for each task.
- Refactored code needs to be in the `index.ts` file for each task.
- Provide the solution the way you think is the most convenient (archive, fork, repo)

Good Luck!
